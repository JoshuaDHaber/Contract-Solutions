# Contract-Solutions

Originally developed as a final project for IGME 430, this application allows for the generation of contracts for RIT Wellness Education employees. Prior to each term, the director can upload all of the courses for a given term from an excel spreadsheet and with a click of a button, produce everyone’s contracts, complete with accurate salary and course teaching information.

# Inspiration
Starting in the Spring of 2017, I took on a versatile role with the RIT Wellness Department. Any random task that required an extra set of hands would be sent my way. From creating training videos to serving as am ambassador, I thought I had done it all. However, in the Summer of 2019, I was asked to manually make the spreadsheet and send out the contracts using Mail Merge. And as the old saying goes, “There has to be a better way.” After experimenting with multiple technologies, I worked with Professor Austin Willoughby to produce the initial prototype for IGME 430 (Rich Media Web Application Development 2), a class I now serve as a teaching assistant for. The tool was used to produce the contracts for the Fall 2020 semester and will only continue to grow.
